## 🔧 Configuration

### API Version
The API version is controlled by the `strapiversion` variable in `main.py`. Update this when making changes to the prompt templates.

### Prompt Templates
The system uses prompt templates stored in the `data/` folder. The current template file is specified in `text2sql.py`.

The current prompt template is specifically designed for a **movie and TV series database** using MariaDB. It includes:

**🎬 Database Schema Coverage:**
- **Movies**: Complete TMDB (The Movie Database) schema with detailed movie information
- **TV Series**: Full series data including episodes, seasons, and network information
- **People**: Actors, directors, and crew members with their roles and relationships
- **Collections**: Movie collections and franchises
- **Companies**: Production companies and studios
- **Ratings**: IMDB ratings integration
- **Genres**: Movie and series genre classifications
- **Languages**: Multi-language support for titles and content
- **Lists**: Curated movie and series lists
- **Images**: Poster, backdrop, and profile image management

**🎯 Key Features:**
- **Smart Title Matching**: Handles English, French, and original language titles
- **Movie Type Detection**: Distinguishes between movies, documentaries, and short films
- **Person Search**: Advanced cast and crew search with role-specific filtering
- **Criterion Collection**: Special handling for Criterion Collection movies
- **Color/B&W Detection**: Filters for color vs black-and-white films
- **Multi-language Support**: Proper handling of international titles
- **Default Sorting**: Intelligent sorting by release date, popularity, etc.

**📋 Query Rules:**
- Returns only valid SQL queries for successful conversions
- Returns `##AMBIGUOUS##` with explanations for unclear requests
- Includes comprehensive join conditions for complex relationships
- Handles edge cases like archive footage exclusions for cast searches
- Supports advanced filtering by decade, genre, rating, and more

**🎭 Specialized Collections:**
The template includes knowledge of famous film collections and trilogies like:
- Nouvelle Vague française
- Sight and Sound's Greatest Films
- Director-specific trilogies (Sergio Leone, Ingmar Bergman, etc.)
- Genre-specific collections (Film Noir, Neorealism, etc.)

This makes the API particularly powerful for film enthusiasts, researchers, and applications requiring sophisticated movie database queries.

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Multi-Level Caching System

The API implements a sophisticated three-tier caching system for optimal performance:

#### 1. **Exact Question Cache (SQL Database)**
- Stores exact question-to-SQL mappings in `T_WC_T2S_CACHE` table
- Instant retrieval for previously asked questions
- Includes processing time metrics and API version tracking
- Supports both original and processed SQL queries

#### 2. **Anonymized Question Cache (SQL Database)**  
- Caches entity-extracted (anonymized) questions
- Enables reuse of SQL logic across similar questions with different entity values
- Example: "Movies with Brad Pitt" and "Movies with Tom Cruise" share the same anonymized pattern

#### 3. **Vector Embeddings Cache (ChromaDB)**
- Uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model for semantic similarity
- Finds similar questions even with different wording
- Configurable similarity threshold (default: 0.1)
- Stores anonymized SQL queries in metadata for quick retrieval

### Entity Extraction & Anonymization

The system intelligently extracts and replaces entities in natural language questions:

- **Person Names**: Actors, directors, crew members
- **Movie Titles**: English, French, and original language titles  
- **TV Series Titles**: Series names in multiple languages
- **Company Names**: Production companies and studios
- **Network Names**: TV networks and streaming platforms
- **Topic Names**: Genres, themes, and categories

**Process Flow:**
1. Extract entities from user question using GPT-4o
2. Replace entities with placeholders (e.g., `{{PERSON_NAME}}`)
3. Check cache for anonymized question pattern
4. Generate SQL if not cached
5. Replace placeholders with actual entity values using vector search

### Vector Search Integration

ChromaDB collections for entity matching:
- `persons`: Actor/director/crew member embeddings
- `movies`: Movie title embeddings (multiple languages)
- `series`: TV series title embeddings
- `companies`: Production company embeddings  
- `networks`: TV network embeddings
- `topics`: Genre/theme embeddings
- `anonymizedqueries`: Cached anonymized question patterns

### Logging
All API requests are automatically logged to the `logs/` folder with:
- Timestamp
- Endpoint used
- API version
- Content hash
- Full request/response data

## 🔒 Security

- **API Key Authentication**: All endpoints (except health check) require a valid API key
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data like OpenAI API keys are stored in environment variables
- **Request Logging**: All API usage is logged for monitoring and debugging

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing OpenAI API Key**
   - Ensure your `.env` file contains a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Check that your OpenAI account has sufficient credits

2. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify you're sending the correct API key in the `X-API-Key` header
   - Ensure `Content-Type: application/json` is set for POST requests

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify database credentials in `.env` file
   - Ensure MariaDB/MySQL server is running and accessible
   - Check that the database contains the required tables (`T_WC_T2S_CACHE`, etc.)

4. **ChromaDB Connection Issues**
   - Ensure ChromaDB server is running on the configured host/port
   - Check `CHROMADB_HOST` and `CHROMADB_PORT` in `.env` file
   - Verify ChromaDB collections are properly initialized

5. **Entity Extraction Failures**
   - The system includes fallback mechanisms for malformed OpenAI responses
   - Check logs for JSON parsing errors and API response issues
   - Entity extraction will fall back to original question if extraction fails

6. **SQL Escaping Issues**
   - The system now properly handles single quotes in movie titles (e.g., "The King's Speech")
   - Uses proper SQL escaping (`''` instead of `\'`) for parameterized queries

7. **Memory Issues**
   - The application monitors system memory and will display usage on startup
   - Large embedding operations may require additional memory

8. **Cache Performance**
   - Monitor cache hit rates in response fields (`cached_exact_question`, etc.)
   - Clear ChromaDB collections if embeddings become stale
   - Check `T_WC_T2S_CACHE` table for SQL cache entries

### Logs
Check the `logs/` folder for detailed request/response logs with comprehensive timing metrics if you encounter issues. Each log file includes:
- Entity extraction processing time
- Text2SQL conversion time  
- Embeddings processing time
- Query execution time
- Cache hit/miss information

## 📝 API Response Format

All successful text2sql requests return a comprehensive response with:

**Core Fields:**
- `question`: The original natural language question
- `question_hashed`: SHA256 hash of the question for pagination/caching
- `sql_query`: The generated and optimized SQL query
- `result`: Array of query results with index and data

**Performance Metrics:**
- `entity_extraction_processing_time`: Time for entity extraction (seconds)

- `limit`: Records per page
- `offset`: Current offset
- `rows_per_page`: Configured page size
