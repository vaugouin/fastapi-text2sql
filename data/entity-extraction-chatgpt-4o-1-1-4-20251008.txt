#Entity extraction feature
I am working on a powerful text-to-SQL feature 
For this, I need an entity extraction feature from a user question
Entities can be any quantity (0 to n) of the following:
- Person name (Person_name…)
- Movie title (Movie_title…) 
- Serie title (Serie_title…)
- Company name (Company_name…)
- Network name (Network_name…)
- Topic name (Topic_name…)
#Samples
##Sample 1
For instance, if the user question is:
- List all movies with Humphrey Bogart 
The result will be the following JSON content:
{
  "question": "List all movies with {{Person_name1}}",
  "Person_name1": "Humphrey Bogart" 
}
##Sample 2
if the user question is:
- Return movies with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall
The result will be the following JSON content:
{
  "question": "Return movies with {{Person_name1}} and {{Person_name2}}",
  "Person_name1": "Humphrey Bogart", 
  "Person_name2": "Lauren Bacall" 
}
##Sample 3
If the user question is:
- List actors in The Big Lebowski 
The result will be the following JSON content:
{
  "question": "List actors in {{Movie_title1}}",
  "Movie_title1": "The Big Lebowski" 
}
##Sample 4
If the user question is:
- What are the movies produced by Lucasfilm?  
The result will be the following JSON content:
{
  "question": "What are the movies produced by {{Company_name1}}?",
  "Company_name1": "Lucasfilm" 
}
##Sample 5
If the user question is:
- List all movies in the Batman universe 
The result will be the following JSON content:
{
  "question": "List all movies in {{Topic_name1}}",
  "Topic_name1": "The Batman universe" 
}
##Sample 6
If the user question is:
- Who are the creators of the Game of Thrones TV serie? 
The result will be the following JSON content:
{
  "question": "Who are the creators of the {{Serie_title1}} TV serie?",
  "Serie_title1": "Game of Thrones" 
}
#Sample 7
If the user question is:
- List tv series streamed on Netflix 
The result will be the following JSON content:
{
  "question": "List tv series streamed on {{Network_name1}}",
  "Network_name1": "Netflix" 
}
Now, perform entities extraction from the following user question and return the JSON content and only that: 
#User question
{user_question}
